Farm Market
Welcome to the Farm Market project repository, a vibrant and interactive web application designed to bring the freshness of the farm directly to your screen. This project combines the simplicity and elegance of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the immersive 3D experiences enabled by Spline, creating a unique online marketplace for farm produce.

Features
Interactive 3D Models: Explore our farm products in stunning 3D, powered by Spline, allowing users to view products in detail from every angle.
Responsive Design: Crafted with HTML and CSS, our layout adapts seamlessly across devices, providing an optimal browsing experience whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
Dynamic Content: Utilizing vanilla JavaScript, the Farm Market dynamically updates content, ensuring users have access to the latest product offerings and information.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with the user in mind, the interface combines aesthetics with functionality, making navigation through the market an intuitive and enjoyable experience.

This is the first project that I have ever created in my whole lifetime
It leverages the use of HTML CSS and JS as well as the 3D library of Spline (Front-end) without Back-end.
This project also marks my first ever project in the Computer Science landscape
